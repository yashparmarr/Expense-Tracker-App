## Difficulties Faced

1. **Currency Formatting**:
   - Displaying all amounts in **Indian Rupees (â‚¹)** required custom JavaScript functions to format numbers using `Intl.NumberFormat`.

2. **Chart Integration**:
   - Integrating **Chart.js** for dynamic data visualization was challenging, especially updating charts in real-time when new expenses were added.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensuring the application looked good on both desktop and mobile devices required careful use of **Tailwind CSS** and custom media queries.

4. **State Management**:
   - Managing the state of expenses, budgets, and tax calculations without a backend or framework like React was tricky. Local storage was used to persist data temporarily.

5. **Animations**:
   - Adding smooth animations and transitions using CSS keyframes and Tailwind classes required fine-tuning to avoid performance issues.
